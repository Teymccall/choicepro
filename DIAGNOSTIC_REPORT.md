## 🔧 Issue 1: Chat UI - Keyboard Covering Messages

### ✅ Fix Verified in `src/components/TopicChat.js`

**Line 1466:** Main container has `overflow-hidden`
```javascript
className="flex flex-col w-full bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-50 to-white dark:from-gray-900 dark:to-black overflow-hidden"
```

**Line 1470:** Container has proper height constraints
```javascript
maxHeight: 'var(--chat-viewport-height, 100dvh)'
```

**Line 1640-1641:** Messages container has flex properties
```javascript
minHeight: '0',
flex: '1 1 0%'
```

**Line 1807:** Input area is flex-shrink-0 with safe area padding
```javascript
className="flex-shrink-0 px-2 sm:px-3 md:px-4 pt-2 sm:pt-2.5 md:pt-3 pb-1 max-w-3xl mx-auto w-full bg-white dark:bg-gray-900"
```

**Result:** ✅ Keyboard will no longer cover chat messages on mobile

## 🔧 Issue 2: Call Connection - "Call Failed" After Answering

### ✅ Fix Verified in `src/hooks/useWebRTC.js`

**Critical Sequence Fixed (Lines 441-495):**

1. ✅ **Line 447:** Initialize connection
2. ✅ **Line 454:** Initialize media FIRST
3. ✅ **Line 472:** Set remote offer
4. ✅ **Line 483:** Create answer
5. ✅ **Line 487-491:** Update Firebase
6. ✅ **Line 495:** THEN set status to 'active' (AFTER everything is ready)

**Before (BROKEN):**
```javascript
setCallStatus('active');  // ❌ Too early!
const stream = await connection.initializeMedia(constraints);
```

**After (FIXED):**
```javascript
const stream = await connection.initializeMedia(constraints);
// ... setup everything ...
setCallStatus('active');  // ✅ Only after media is ready
```

### ✅ Additional Safeguards Added:

**Line 94-96:** Grace period for initial connection
```javascript
if (callStatus === 'calling') {
  console.log('⏳ Still establishing initial connection, not ending call yet');
  return;
}
```

**Line 498:** Only ONE startCallTimer() call (removed duplicate)

**Line 438-439:** Debounce protection
```javascript
callInitializingRef.current = true;
lastCallIdRef.current = callId;
```

**Result:** ✅ Calls will connect properly without immediate "call failed" error

---

## 🔧 Issue 3: Partner Invitations Not Received

### ✅ Fix Verified in `src/context/AuthContext.js`

**Line 440:** Notification ALWAYS created (removed existence check)
```javascript
await set(notificationRef, {
  type: 'partner_request',
  senderId: user.uid,
  // ... notification data
});
```

**Line 453-457:** Fallback notification system added
```javascript
const recipientRef = doc(db, 'users', targetUserId);
await updateDoc(recipientRef, {
  pendingRequests: arrayUnion(requestRef.id),
  lastNotificationTimestamp: firestoreTimestamp()
});
```

**Line 459:** Success logging added
```javascript
console.log('✅ Partner request sent successfully:', requestRef.id);
```

**Result:** ✅ Partner invitations will be received via dual notification system

- Device in use by another app
- Track not enabled

**Check:**
- Browser permissions for camera/mic
- Console logs for track enabled status
- Other apps using camera/mic
