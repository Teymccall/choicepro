# Video Display Issue - Debugging & Fix

## 🐛 Issue Reported

During video calls:
- ✅ **Local video (your camera)** shows in small PiP box (top right)
- ❌ **Remote video (partner's camera)** shows BLACK on main screen
- ✅ Connection shows "Connected" status
- ❌ Should see partner's video on main screen

## 🔍 What I've Fixed

### 1. **Added Comprehensive Logging**
The app will now show detailed console logs to help debug:

```javascript
🎥 Received remote track: video enabled: true
📺 Remote streams available: 1
📹 Remote stream tracks: ['video', 'audio']
✅ Set remote stream to video element
🎬 Remote video metadata loaded
▶️ Remote video started playing
```

### 2. **Force Remote Video to Play**
Added automatic play when remote stream is received:
- Stream is set to video element
- Video automatically plays
- Errors are logged if play fails

### 3. **Added Fallback UI**
If remote video doesn't load, shows:
- Partner's profile picture
- "Waiting for video..." message
- "Partner may have camera off" hint

## 📋 Testing Instructions

### **Step 1: Open Browser Console**
1. Before making a call, open browser DevTools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Keep it open during the call

### **Step 2: Make a Video Call**
1. Start a video call
2. Have partner accept

### **Step 3: Check Console Logs**

**What to Look For:**

#### ✅ **Good Signs (Everything Working):**
```
🎥 Received remote track: video enabled: true
📺 Remote streams available: 1
📹 Remote stream tracks: ['video', 'audio']
✅ Set remote stream to video element
🎬 Remote video metadata loaded
▶️ Remote video started playing
```

#### ⚠️ **Problem Signs:**

**A. No Remote Tracks Received:**
```
❌ No "Received remote track" messages
```
**Cause:** ICE connection not established or peer not sending tracks
**Solution:** Check TURN servers, firewall settings

**B. Remote Stream But No Video Track:**
```
📹 Remote stream tracks: ['audio']  ← Missing 'video'
```
**Cause:** Partner's camera is off or permission denied
**Solution:** Partner needs to enable camera

**C. Video Track Received But Won't Play:**
```
✅ Set remote stream to video element
❌ Remote video play error: NotAllowedError
```
**Cause:** Browser autoplay policy blocking video
**Solution:** User interaction required (browser limitation)

**D. Remote Video Ref Not Available:**
```
⚠️ Remote video ref not available yet
```
**Cause:** Timing issue - video element not rendered when stream arrives
**Solution:** Stream will be set when element renders

### **Step 4: Check Video Elements**

In browser console, type:
```javascript
// Check if local video has stream
console.log('Local video:', document.querySelector('video.mirror')?.srcObject);

// Check if remote video has stream  
const remoteVideo = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('video')).find(v => !v.classList.contains('mirror'));
console.log('Remote video:', remoteVideo?.srcObject);
console.log('Remote tracks:', remoteVideo?.srcObject?.getTracks());
```

## 🎯 Expected Flow

### **Caller Side (You):**
```
1. Click video call button
   → 📹 Local video shows full screen (your camera)
   → "Ringing..." overlay

2. Partner answers
   → 🎥 Received remote track events fire
   → 📺 Remote video loads on main screen
   → 📹 Local video moves to PiP (small box, top right)
   → ✅ Connected!
```

### **Callee Side (Partner):**
```
1. Incoming call notification
   → Click accept

2. Camera permission prompt
   → Allow camera

3. Call connects
   → 🎥 Sends video track to caller
   → 📺 Receives caller's video on main screen
   → 📹 Own video shows in PiP
   → ✅ Connected!
```

## 🔧 Possible Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Camera Permission Denied**
**Symptoms:**
- Black screen or "No camera stream" error
- Console shows: `NotAllowedError`

**Solution:**
1. Click camera icon in browser address bar
2. Allow camera and microphone
3. Refresh page and try again

### **Issue 2: Camera Already in Use**
**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Device already in use"
- Console shows: `NotReadableError`

**Solution:**
1. Close other apps using camera (Zoom, Teams, Skype, etc.)
2. Try call again

### **Issue 3: No Video Track Sent**
**Symptoms:**
- Partner can see you, but you can't see them (or vice versa)
- Console shows: `Remote stream tracks: ['audio']`

**Solution:**
- Partner needs to enable camera
- Check if video is toggled off (camera button)
- Partner may need to grant camera permission

### **Issue 4: Firewall/NAT Issues**
**Symptoms:**
- Call connects but video is black
- Console shows: "ICE connection state: failed"

**Solution:**
- TURN servers should handle this automatically
- Check if corporate firewall is blocking WebRTC
- Try on different network (mobile data)

### **Issue 5: Browser Compatibility**
**Symptoms:**
- No video displays at all
- Console shows: browser not supported errors

**Solution:**
- Use Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)
- Avoid older browsers or IE

## 📊 Debugging Checklist

Run through this checklist if video doesn't show:

- [ ] Browser console open and checking logs
- [ ] Camera permission granted (both sides)
- [ ] No other apps using camera
- [ ] "Connected" status shows (green dot)
- [ ] Check console for "Received remote track" messages
- [ ] Check console for "Remote video started playing"
- [ ] Try toggling video off/on with camera button
- [ ] Try ending call and starting new one
- [ ] Try refreshing page
- [ ] Try different browser
- [ ] Try different network

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the call with console open**
2. **Share console logs** if issue persists
3. **Check which scenario matches** from the list above

The detailed logging will help identify exactly where the video flow is breaking!

## 🎥 Expected Video Layout

### While Calling (Before Connection):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│                                 │
│     YOUR VIDEO (Full Screen)    │
│                                 │
│         [Ringing...]            │
│                                 │
│     [Controls at bottom]        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### During Active Call (After Connection):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  PARTNER'S VIDEO (Full Screen)  │
│                                 │
│  ┌─────────┐                   │
│  │  YOUR   │  ← PiP (small box) │
│  │  VIDEO  │                    │
│  └─────────┘                    │
│                                 │
│     [Controls at bottom]        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

This is the correct behavior! If you're not seeing this, the console logs will tell us why.
