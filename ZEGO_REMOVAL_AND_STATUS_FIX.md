# ZegoCloud Removal & Online Status Fix

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. Firebase Realtime Database Rules Deployed ✅

**Deployed to:** `choice-4496c-default-rtdb`

**Key Fix:** Updated `calls` rules to allow proper read/write access:
```json
"calls": {
  ".indexOn": ["recipient"],
  "$callId": {
    ".read": "auth != null",  // ✅ Simplified - any authenticated user can read
    ".write": "auth != null && ((data.child('caller').val() === auth.uid || data.child('recipient').val() === auth.uid) || (newData.child('caller').val() === auth.uid || newData.child('recipient').val() === auth.uid))"
  }
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- Previous rules were too restrictive and caused permission errors
- Receiver couldn't update call with answer
- Calls would hang up immediately after being answered

---

### 2. ZegoCloud Components Removed ✅

**Removed Files/Imports:**
- ❌ `CallManager` component (from App.js)
- ❌ `CallButtons` import and usage (from Navigation.js)

**What's Now Active:**
- ✅ **WebRTC System** (native WebRTC via `useWebRTC` hook)
  - Located in: `src/hooks/useWebRTC.js`
  - UI Component: `src/components/VideoCall.js`
  - Context: `src/context/WebRTCContext.js`
  - Used in: `src/components/Layout.js` and `src/components/TopicChat.js`

**Files Modified:**
```diff
// src/App.js
- import CallManager from './components/CallManager';
- <CallManager />

// src/components/Navigation.js
- import CallButtons from './CallButtons';
- <CallButtons />
```

**Why this matters:**
- No more conflicting calling systems
- Cleaner codebase
- Better maintainability
- WebRTC is more flexible and doesn't require external API keys

### 3. Online/Offline Status Fixed ✅

**Problem:**
Partners showed as "Offline" even when they were online and connected in the chat.

**Root Cause:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - TopicChat.js was listening to the wrong Firebase path
const partnerConnectionRef = ref(rtdb, `connections/${partner.uid}`);
```

The status was being written to `presence/${partner.uid}` in AuthContext, but TopicChat was reading from `connections/${partner.uid}`.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Now listening to the right path
const partnerPresenceRef = ref(rtdb, `presence/${partner.uid}`);

const unsubscribe = onValue(partnerPresenceRef, (snapshot) => {
  const presenceData = snapshot.exists() ? snapshot.val() : null;
  const isConnected = presenceData?.isOnline === true;  // ✅ Using isOnline boolean
  
  setPartnerData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    isOnline: isConnected,
    lastOnline: presenceData?.lastOnline,
    connectionId: presenceData?.connectionId
  }));
});
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/TopicChat.js` (lines 385-413)

**What Changed:**
- ✅ Changed from `connections/` to `presence/` path
- ✅ Reading `isOnline` boolean instead of `status === 'online'`
- ✅ Properly updating `partnerData` state with presence info

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Online Status Flow:

1. **User logs in** → AuthContext sets up presence system
   ```javascript
   // AuthContext.js line 827-831
   await set(userPresenceRef, {
     isOnline: true,
     lastOnline: serverTimestamp(),
     connectionId: Date.now().toString()
   });
   ```

2. **Partner's app listens** → AuthContext monitors partner presence
   ```javascript
   // AuthContext.js line 839-850
   const partnerPresenceRef = ref(rtdb, `presence/${partnerId}`);
   onValue(partnerPresenceRef, (presenceSnapshot) => {
     const presenceData = presenceSnapshot.val();
     setPartner(current => ({
       ...current,
       isOnline: presenceData.isOnline,  // ✅ Updates partner state
       lastOnline: presenceData.lastOnline
     }));
   });
   ```

3. **TopicChat displays status** → Now reads from correct source
   ```javascript
   // TopicChat.js line 388-407
   const partnerPresenceRef = ref(rtdb, `presence/${partner.uid}`);
   onValue(partnerPresenceRef, (snapshot) => {
     setPartnerData(prev => ({
       ...prev,
       isOnline: presenceData?.isOnline === true  // ✅ Boolean check
     }));
   });
   ```

4. **UI shows correct status:**
   ```jsx
   {partnerData?.isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline'}  // ✅ Works correctly now
   ```

### Calling System Flow:

**Caller (Partner A):**
1. Clicks call button in TopicChat → `webRTC.startCall('audio' | 'video')`
2. Gets camera/mic permissions
3. Creates WebRTC peer connection
4. Writes call data to Firebase: `calls/{randomId}`
5. Status: `'calling'` → Shows calling UI
6. Waits for partner to accept

**Receiver (Partner B):**
1. Sees incoming call notification in Layout
2. Clicks Accept → `webRTC.acceptIncomingCall()`
3. Gets camera/mic permissions
4. Sets remote offer from caller
5. Creates answer and updates Firebase
6. Status: `'active'` → Both see VideoCall UI

**Both Partners:**
- Media streams connect
- Can toggle audio/video/speaker
- See call timer
- Can end call anytime

## 📊 Testing Checklist

### Online Status:
- [x] Partner A logs in → Shows as Online to Partner B ✅
- [x] Partner B logs in → Shows as Online to Partner A ✅
- [ ] Partner A logs out → Shows as Offline to Partner B
- [ ] Partner B refreshes page → Still shows as Online
- [ ] Both partners in chat → Both show Online

### Audio Calls:
- [ ] Partner A calls Partner B (audio) → Connects
- [ ] Both hear audio clearly
- [ ] Mute button works
- [ ] Speaker toggle works
- [ ] Call timer shows on both sides
- [ ] Either can end call

### Video Calls:
- [ ] Partner A calls Partner B (video) → Connects
- [ ] Both see video + hear audio
- [ ] Local video shows in PiP
- [ ] Remote video shows full screen
- [ ] Camera toggle works
- [ ] Video quality is good
- [ ] Either can end call

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Reject call → Caller notified
- [ ] Call during poor network → Reconnects
- [ ] Rapid call/end → No ghost calls
- [ ] Page refresh during call → Call ends cleanly

## 📝 Technical Details

### Firebase Presence System:
```
presence/
  └─ {userId}/
      ├─ isOnline: boolean
      ├─ lastOnline: timestamp
      └─ connectionId: string
```

### Firebase Calls System:
```
calls/
  └─ {callId}/
      ├─ caller: uid
      ├─ recipient: uid
      ├─ type: 'audio' | 'video'
      ├─ status: 'ringing' | 'active' | 'ended' | 'rejected'
      ├─ offer: {SDP}
      ├─ answer: {SDP}
      ├─ callerCandidates/
      │   └─ {candidateId}: {ICE candidate}
      └─ recipientCandidates/
          └─ {candidateId}: {ICE candidate}
```

### WebRTC Call States:
- `idle` - No active call
- `calling` - Outgoing call, waiting for answer
- `ringing` - Incoming call, not yet answered
- `active` - Call connected, media flowing
- `ended` - Call finished
