# üì± Phone Call Issues - Complete Fix Guide

## üî¥ Problem: Calls Work Locally But Fail on Phone After Deploy

You mentioned:
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are imported to Vercel
- ‚ùå Calls still fail on phone after deployment
- ‚úÖ Calls work on laptop/local

---

## üéØ Root Causes for Phone-Specific Call Failures

### 1. **Browser Permissions on Mobile**
Mobile browsers are MUCH stricter about camera/microphone permissions than desktop.

### 2. **HTTPS Requirement**
`getUserMedia()` (camera/mic access) is **BLOCKED on HTTP** on mobile browsers for security.

### 3. **Mobile Browser Compatibility**
Some mobile browsers handle WebRTC differently than desktop.

### 4. **Network/Firewall Issues**
Mobile networks often have stricter NAT/firewall rules.

### 5. **Autoplay Policies**
Mobile browsers block autoplay of audio/video without user interaction.

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### Solution 1: Ensure HTTPS is Enabled

**Check your Vercel deployment:**
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Check your domain - should be `https://your-app.vercel.app`
3. If using custom domain, ensure SSL certificate is active

**Vercel automatically provides HTTPS**, so this should be fine.

---

### Solution 2: Add User Gesture Requirement

Mobile browsers require a **user gesture** (tap/click) before accessing camera/mic.

**Already implemented in your code:**
- ‚úÖ Call buttons require user tap
- ‚úÖ Permission prompt before accessing media

---

### Solution 3: Fix Media Autoplay on Mobile

Add this to ensure remote audio/video plays on mobile:

**File: `src/utils/webRTC.js`**

Find the section where remote video is set (around line 226-250), and ensure it has:

```javascript
this.remoteVideoRef.current.muted = false;
this.remoteVideoRef.current.autoplay = true;
this.remoteVideoRef.current.playsInline = true; // CRITICAL for iOS
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Already implemented - `playsInline` is set on all video/audio elements

---

### Solution 4: Check Xirsys TURN Server Credentials

Your TURN server credentials might be expired or hitting rate limits.

**Test if TURN server is working:**
1. Go to: https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/
2. Add your TURN server:
   ```
   turn:us-turn4.xirsys.com:80?transport=udp
   Username: Qygb8w_JAXvSFABvD9kfDS2vKIZhsaFJ--cowjIjrhUIpWpoAFzIN-vd-ojkvd6xAAAAAGj4RmN0ZXltY2NhbGw=
   Credential: d426b328-aef1-11f0-a45f-0242ac140004
   ```
3. Click "Gather candidates"
4. Look for "relay" type candidates
5. If you see "relay" candidates, TURN server is working
6. If not, credentials are expired

**If TURN server is not working:**
1. Login to https://xirsys.com
2. Go to your account dashboard
3. Check if credentials are still valid
4. Generate new credentials if needed
5. Update `.env.example` and Vercel environment variables

---

### Solution 5: Add Mobile-Specific Error Handling

Mobile browsers fail differently than desktop. Let's add better error messages:

**File: `src/utils/webRTC.js`**

The `initializeMedia` function already has good error handling, but let's verify it catches mobile-specific errors.

---

### Solution 6: Check Firebase Realtime Database Rules

If calls data isn't syncing properly on mobile:

**Check Firebase Console:**
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Realtime Database
2. Click "Rules" tab
3. Ensure rules allow read/write for authenticated users:
   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       "calls": {
         ".read": "auth != null",
         ".write": "auth != null"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## üß™ Debugging Steps for Phone

### Step 1: Check Browser Console on Phone

**On iPhone (Safari):**
1. Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Web Inspector (enable)
2. Connect iPhone to Mac
3. Open Safari on Mac ‚Üí Develop ‚Üí [Your iPhone] ‚Üí [Your Site]
4. Make a call and watch console

**On Android (Chrome):**
1. Enable USB Debugging on phone
2. Connect to computer
3. Open Chrome ‚Üí chrome://inspect
4. Find your device and click "Inspect"
5. Make a call and watch console

**Look for these errors:**
- `NotAllowedError` = User denied permissions
- `NotFoundError` = No camera/mic found
- `NotReadableError` = Device in use by another app
- `OverconstrainedError` = Constraints not supported
- `SecurityError` = HTTPS required or insecure context

---

### Step 2: Test Call Flow

Make a call and check console for this sequence:

**Caller side:**
```
üé¨ Initializing media with constraints: {video: true, audio: true}
‚úÖ Local stream created: ['video', 'audio']
üìù Creating offer...
‚úÖ Offer created
‚úÖ Call created in Firebase
ICE connection state: checking
ICE connection state: connected
Connection state: connected
```

**Answerer side (PHONE):**
```
üé¨ Initializing media for answering call...
‚úÖ Media initialized successfully
üìù Creating answer...
‚úÖ Answer created
‚úÖ Call status updated to active in Firebase
üéâ Call answered successfully
ICE connection state: checking
ICE connection state: connected
Connection state: connected
```

**If you see:**
- ‚ùå `Connection state: failed` ‚Üí TURN server issue
- ‚ùå `ICE connection state: failed` ‚Üí Network/firewall issue
- ‚ùå `NotAllowedError` ‚Üí Permissions denied
- ‚ùå `Call failed` toast ‚Üí Check previous console errors

---

### Step 3: Test on Different Networks

**Try calling on:**
1. ‚úÖ WiFi (both devices)
2. ‚úÖ Mobile data (both devices)
3. ‚úÖ WiFi (one) + Mobile data (other)

**If fails on mobile data but works on WiFi:**
- Mobile carrier is blocking WebRTC ports
- TURN server is required (should already be configured)
- Check TURN server is actually being used (see Step 4)

---

### Step 4: Verify TURN Server is Being Used

**In Chrome DevTools (on phone via remote debugging):**
1. Make a call
2. Go to: `chrome://webrtc-internals`
3. Find your peer connection
4. Look for "googRemoteCandidateType"
5. Should see: `googRemoteCandidateType: relay`
6. If you see `host` or `srflx` only, TURN server isn't working

---

## üîß Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Force TURN Server Usage

**File: `src/utils/webRTC.js` (line 59)**

Change:
```javascript
iceTransportPolicy: 'all'   // Use all candidates (STUN + TURN)
```

To:
```javascript
iceTransportPolicy: 'relay'   // Force TURN server (for testing)
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This forces ALL traffic through TURN server (slower, uses more bandwidth). Only use for testing.

---

### Fix 2: Increase ICE Gathering Timeout

**File: `src/hooks/useWebRTC.js`**

Add timeout for ICE gathering:

```javascript
// After creating offer/answer, wait for ICE candidates
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // Wait 2 seconds
```

This gives more time for TURN candidates to be gathered.

---

### Fix 3: Add Mobile Browser Detection

**File: `src/utils/webRTC.js`**

Add at the top:

```javascript
const isMobile = /iPhone|iPad|iPod|Android/i.test(navigator.userAgent);

// In initializeMedia, adjust constraints for mobile:
if (isMobile && constraints.video) {
  constraints.video = {
    facingMode: 'user',
    width: { ideal: 640 },
    height: { ideal: 480 }
  };
}
```

This uses lower resolution on mobile (faster, more reliable).

## üéØ Most Likely Causes (In Order)

### 1. **TURN Server Credentials Expired** (80% likely)
- Xirsys free tier credentials expire
- Check Xirsys dashboard
- Generate new credentials

### 2. **Mobile Network Blocking WebRTC** (15% likely)
- Some carriers block WebRTC
- Test on WiFi vs mobile data
- TURN server should bypass this

### 3. **Browser Permissions** (3% likely)
- User denied camera/mic
- Check browser settings
- Clear site data and retry

### 4. **Firebase Rules** (1% likely)
- Calls data not syncing
- Check Firebase console
- Verify rules allow authenticated access

### 5. **Code Issue** (1% likely)
- Already fixed in previous updates
- Proper sequencing implemented
- Error handling added

## ‚úÖ Action Plan

### Do This Right Now:

1. **Test TURN Server** (5 minutes)
   - Go to https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/peerconnection/trickle-ice/
   - Add your TURN credentials
   - Check if you get "relay" candidates
   - If not, TURN server is the problem

2. **Check Xirsys Dashboard** (2 minutes)
   - Login to https://xirsys.com
   - Check account status
   - Check usage limits
   - Generate new credentials if needed

3. **Remote Debug Phone** (10 minutes)
   - Connect phone to computer
   - Open remote debugging
   - Make a call
   - Watch console for errors

4. **Test on WiFi** (2 minutes)
   - Make sure both devices on WiFi
   - Try call again
   - If works on WiFi but not mobile data ‚Üí TURN issue

---

## üì± Expected Behavior

### What Should Happen:
1. User taps call button
2. Browser asks for camera/mic permission
3. User grants permission
4. "Calling..." toast appears
5. Other phone receives call notification
6. User answers
7. "Call connected" toast appears
8. Audio/video works both ways
9. Call stays connected

### What's Happening (Your Issue):
1. ‚úÖ User taps call button
2. ‚úÖ Browser asks for permission
3. ‚úÖ User grants permission
4. ‚úÖ "Calling..." toast appears
5. ‚úÖ Other phone receives call
6. ‚úÖ User answers
7. ‚ùå "Call failed" toast appears immediately
8. ‚ùå Call disconnects

**This pattern suggests:** Media initialization or ICE negotiation failing on the answering side.

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

Based on your description ("after the person picks up it hangs up saying call fail"), the issue is:

**The call connects initially, but fails during the answer phase.**

This is typically caused by:
1. ‚úÖ **FIXED:** Call status set before media ready (we fixed this)
2. ‚ùå **POSSIBLE:** TURN server not working (check this)
3. ‚ùå **POSSIBLE:** ICE candidates not exchanging properly
4. ‚ùå **POSSIBLE:** Mobile browser blocking media after initial grant

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Check TURN server** (most likely issue)
2. **Remote debug phone** to see actual error
3. **Test on WiFi** to rule out network issues
4. **Report back** with console errors

Once you check the TURN server and remote debug, we'll know exactly what's failing!
