# Audio Call & Presence Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Audio Calls Stuck - Infinite "Waiting for video ref"

**Problem:**
```
webRTC.js:483 ⌛ Pending local stream waiting for video ref
webRTC.js:483 ⌛ Pending local stream waiting for video ref
... (infinite loop)
```

**Root Cause:**
The WebRTC system was trying to attach local media stream to a `localVideoRef` for ALL calls, including audio calls. For audio calls, there's no local video preview needed, so `localVideoRef.current` never exists, causing infinite polling.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// src/utils/webRTC.js - applyPendingLocalStream()
applyPendingLocalStream(callType = 'video') {
  // For audio calls, clear pending stream immediately - no video ref needed
  if (callType === 'audio' && this.pendingLocalStream) {
    console.log('🎵 Audio call - skipping local video ref (not needed)');
    this.pendingLocalStream = null;
    if (this.pendingLocalStreamInterval) {
      clearInterval(this.pendingLocalStreamInterval);
      this.pendingLocalStreamInterval = null;
    }
    return true;
  }
  // ... video call logic
}
```

```javascript
// src/hooks/useWebRTC.js
useEffect(() => {
  if (callStatus !== 'idle' && webRTCConnectionRef.current) {
    // For audio calls, apply immediately (no video ref needed)
    // For video calls, wait for localVideoRef.current
    if (callType === 'audio' || localVideoRef.current) {
      const applied = webRTCConnectionRef.current.applyPendingLocalStream(callType);
      if (applied) {
        console.log('✅ Applied pending local stream after video element rendered');
      }
    }
  }
}, [callStatus, callType, localVideoRef]);
```

**Result:** ✅ Audio calls now connect immediately without waiting for video ref

### Issue #2: Partner Request Accepted But Sender Needs to Refresh

**Problem:**
- Partner B accepts connection request
- Partner A (sender) doesn't see the connection until page refresh
- Dashboard still shows "Connect with Partner" form

**Root Cause:**
The Firestore listener for user updates had a condition that prevented re-fetching partner data:
```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE - Only fetched if partner was null or different
else if (userData.partnerId && (!partner || partner.uid !== userData.partnerId)) {
  // fetch partner
}
```

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// ✅ AFTER - Always fetch fresh partner data when partnerId exists
else if (userData.partnerId) {
  // Always fetch fresh partner data when partnerId changes
  // This ensures sender sees accepted request immediately
  const partnerRef = doc(db, 'users', userData.partnerId);
  const partnerDoc = await getDoc(partnerRef);
  if (partnerDoc.exists()) {
    const partnerData = partnerDoc.data();
    setPartner(partnerData);
    console.log('✅ Partner updated:', partnerData.displayName);
    
    // Set up presence for newly connected partner
    const partnerPresenceRef = ref(rtdb, `presence/${userData.partnerId}`);
    const partnerPresenceUnsubscribe = onValue(partnerPresenceRef, (presenceSnapshot) => {
      if (presenceSnapshot.exists()) {
        const presenceData = presenceSnapshot.val();
        setPartner(current => ({
          ...current,
          isOnline: presenceData.isOnline,
          lastOnline: presenceData.lastOnline
        }));
      }
    });
    listenerCleanups.current.push(partnerPresenceUnsubscribe);
  }
}
```

**Result:** ✅ Both partners see the connection immediately without refresh

---

### Issue #3: One Partner Shows Online, Other Shows Offline

**Problem:**
- Both partners are online and connected
- One shows "Online 🟢" but the other shows "Offline"
- Inconsistent presence status

**Root Cause:**
Multiple issues:
1. TopicChat was listening to wrong Firebase path (`connections/` instead of `presence/`) - FIXED in previous update
2. When partner connection is newly made, presence listener wasn't being set up immediately for the sender

**Fix Applied:**
In the fix for Issue #2 above, we now immediately set up the presence listener when a new partner connection is detected:

```javascript
// Set up presence for newly connected partner
const partnerPresenceRef = ref(rtdb, `presence/${userData.partnerId}`);
const partnerPresenceUnsubscribe = onValue(partnerPresenceRef, (presenceSnapshot) => {
  if (presenceSnapshot.exists()) {
    const presenceData = presenceSnapshot.val();
    setPartner(current => ({
      ...current,
      isOnline: presenceData.isOnline,
      lastOnline: presenceData.lastOnline,
      connectionId: presenceData.connectionId
    }));
  }
});
```

**Result:** ✅ Both partners see each other's online status in real-time

## 📊 Files Modified

| File | Changes | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `src/utils/webRTC.js` | Added callType parameter to `applyPendingLocalStream()` | Skip video ref for audio calls |
| `src/hooks/useWebRTC.js` | Pass callType to applyPendingLocalStream, apply immediately for audio | Fix audio call connection |
| `src/context/AuthContext.js` | Always fetch partner data on partnerId change + set up presence | Real-time partner updates & presence |

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Audio Call Flow:
1. **Partner A calls Partner B (audio)**
2. Media stream acquired (audio only)
3. ✅ **No waiting for video ref** - immediately proceeds
4. WebRTC connection established
5. Both partners hear audio
6. Call timer starts
7. Both can mute/unmute, toggle speaker
8. Either can end call

### Partner Connection Flow:
1. **Partner A sends request** to Partner B
2. Partner B accepts request
3. ✅ **Both see connection immediately** (no refresh needed)
4. ✅ **Presence listeners set up for both**
5. Both show "Online 🟢" status
6. Dashboard updates with partner info
7. Ready to chat and call!

### Presence System:
```
User logs in
  ↓
AuthContext sets presence/
  {userId}/
    ├─ isOnline: true
    ├─ lastOnline: timestamp
    └─ connectionId: string
  ↓
Partner's listener detects presence
  ↓
TopicChat updates UI
  ↓
Shows "Online 🟢" or "Offline" correctly
```
