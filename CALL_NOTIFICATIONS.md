# Call Notifications System

## ✅ Problem Solved!

**Before**: Partner needed to have the app open to see incoming calls  
**After**: Partner gets notified even when app is closed or minimized!

## 🔔 How It Works Now

### **1. When Someone Calls You:**

```
User A clicks "Video Call"
        ↓
🔥 Firebase creates call document
        ↓
🔔 Notification sent to User B
        ↓
📱 User B gets notification (even if app closed!)
        ↓
✅ User B opens app and sees incoming call
```

### **2. Notification Delivery:**

#### **App Open:**
- ✅ Incoming call overlay appears immediately
- ✅ Full-screen accept/reject interface
- ✅ Audio/video call indicator

#### **App Minimized:**
- ✅ Notification appears in notification bell
- ✅ Shows caller name and call type
- ✅ Click to open chat and answer

#### **App Closed (PWA):**
- ✅ Browser/PWA push notification
- ✅ Shows caller and call type
- ✅ Click notification to open app
- ✅ Incoming call overlay appears

## 📋 What's Included
