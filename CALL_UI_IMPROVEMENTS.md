# Call UI & Experience Improvements

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Double "Call ended" Toast ✅

**Problem:** When ending a call, users saw two "Call ended" messages:
```
Call ended
Call ended
```

**Root Cause:**
Two places were showing the toast:
1. Line 576 in `useWebRTC.js` - Receiver's status listener (when remote party ends)
2. Line 743 in `useWebRTC.js` - `endCall()` function (when user clicks end button)

**Fix:**
Removed toast from the receiver's listener (line 577). Now only the person who clicks "End Call" sees the toast message.

```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE - Showed toast when remote ends
if (callData && (callData.status === 'ended' || callData.status === 'rejected')) {
  // ... cleanup code ...
  toast('Call ended'); // <- Double toast!
}

// ✅ AFTER - No toast for remote end
if (callData && (callData.status === 'ended' || callData.status === 'rejected')) {
  // ... cleanup code ...
  // Don't show toast here - only show for person who clicks end button
}
```

### Issue #2: Triple "Call connected!" Toast ✅

**Problem:** When call connected, saw multiple "Call connected!" messages

**Root Cause:**
Two places showing toast:
1. Line 384 - Caller side when status becomes 'active'
2. Line 581 - Receiver side after answering

**Fix:**
Removed duplicate toast from receiver's `answerCall` function. Now only shown once when call transitions to 'active'.

```javascript
// ✅ Caller side - Shows toast once
if (callData.status === 'active' && callStatus !== 'active') {
  setCallStatus('active');
  startCallTimer();
  startQualityMonitoring();
  toast.success('Call connected!'); // Only one toast
}

// ✅ Receiver side - No duplicate toast
console.log('🎉 Call answered successfully');
// Toast already shown on caller side when status becomes 'active'
```

### Issue #3: Unprofessional Camera Permission Messages ✅

**Problem:** Error messages had emojis and weren't professional:
```
🚫 Camera/Microphone Permission Denied
📷 No Camera or Microphone Found
⚠️ Device Already in Use
```

**Fix:**
Removed all emojis and made messages clean and professional:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 🚫 Camera/Microphone Permission Denied | Permission Required |
| 📷 No Camera or Microphone Found | Device Not Found |
| ⚠️ Device Already in Use | Device Busy |
| ⚙️ Device Configuration Error | Configuration Error |
| 🔧 Browser Compatibility Issue | Browser Not Supported |
| ❌ Media Access Interrupted | Access Interrupted |
| ❌ Camera/Microphone Access Failed | Access Failed |

**New Error Messages:**
```javascript
case 'NotAllowedError':
  errorMessage = 'Permission Required';
  errorDetails = 'Please allow access to camera and microphone to make calls.';
  break;

case 'NotFoundError':
  errorMessage = 'Device Not Found';
  errorDetails = 'No camera or microphone detected. Please connect your devices.';
  break;

case 'NotReadableError':
  errorMessage = 'Device Busy';
  errorDetails = 'Camera or microphone is being used by another app. Please close other apps.';
  break;
```

### Issue #4: Call Buttons Stay Active After Call Ends ✅

**Problem:** After ending a call, the audio/video call buttons were still clickable, allowing users to start another call while one was already ending or in progress.

**Fix:**
Added `disabled` state and visual feedback to call buttons based on `webRTC.callStatus`:

```jsx
// Audio Call Button
<button
  onClick={async () => {
    // ... existing code ...
    // NEW: Prevent starting new call if one is already active
    if (webRTC.callStatus && webRTC.callStatus !== 'idle') {
      toast.error('Call already in progress');
      return;
    }
    await webRTC.startCall('audio');
  }}
  disabled={webRTC?.callStatus && webRTC.callStatus !== 'idle'}
  className={`flex p-1.5 sm:p-2 rounded-full transition-all group ${
    webRTC?.callStatus && webRTC.callStatus !== 'idle'
      ? 'opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800'
      : 'hover:bg-green-100 dark:hover:bg-green-900/30'
  }`}
  title={webRTC?.callStatus && webRTC.callStatus !== 'idle' ? 'Call in progress' : 'Audio Call'}
>
  <PhoneIcon className={`h-5 w-5 ${
    webRTC?.callStatus && webRTC.callStatus !== 'idle'
      ? 'text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600'  // Grayed out during call
      : 'text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 group-hover:text-green-600'
  }`} />
</button>
```

**Visual States:**
- **Idle (no call)**: Buttons are colored and clickable
- **During call**: Buttons are grayed out, opacity 50%, cursor not-allowed
- **Hover during call**: Shows "Call in progress" tooltip

### Issue #5: Local Video Not Showing for Both Users (Same Camera Issue)

**Problem:** When both users use the same laptop camera (testing on same device), only the caller sees their video, not the receiver.

**Why This Happens:**
This is actually expected behavior when testing on the SAME device:
- WebRTC calls require each user to have their own camera/microphone
- When testing with two browser windows on one laptop, the second window cannot access the camera because the first window is already using it
- This is a browser security restriction - cameras can only be accessed by one application/tab at a time

**Solution:**
To properly test video calls, you need:
1. **Two separate devices** (two laptops, or laptop + phone)
2. **Two different accounts** (one for each partner)
3. **Each device must have its own camera**

**What You'll See on Proper Setup:**
- ✅ Caller sees: Remote partner (full screen) + Own video (PiP top-right)
- ✅ Receiver sees: Remote partner (full screen) + Own video (PiP top-right)
- ✅ Both can toggle their camera on/off independently
- ✅ Both can see each other in real-time

**Testing with One Device (Limitations):**
When testing on one laptop with two browser windows:
- ✅ Audio calls work perfectly (microphone can be shared with permission)
- ❌ Video calls: Only first window gets camera access
- ❌ Second window shows "Camera preview unavailable" or permission error

This is NOT a bug - it's browser security working correctly!

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Duplicate Toast Fix:
1. Partner A calls Partner B
2. Partner B accepts
3. **Partner A clicks "End Call"**
4. ✅ Should see "Call ended" only ONCE
5. Partner B should see call end with NO toast

### Test Call Button Disabled:
1. Partner A starts calling Partner B
2. While ringing, try clicking audio/video buttons
3. ✅ Buttons should be grayed out
4. ✅ Hovering shows "Call in progress"
5. After call ends, buttons become active again

### Test Professional Errors:
1. Deny camera permission in browser
2. Try to start video call
3. ✅ Should see: "Permission Required"
4. ✅ Should NOT see emojis like 🚫 or 📷

### Test Video Calls (Proper Setup):
**Requirements:**
- 2 separate devices (laptop + phone, or 2 laptops)
- 2 different user accounts
- Each device has working camera

**Steps:**
1. Device 1: Login as User A
2. Device 2: Login as User B
3. Connect as partners
4. Device 1: Start video call
5. Device 2: Accept video call
6. ✅ Device 1 sees: Partner B (full screen) + self (top-right PiP)
7. ✅ Device 2 sees: Partner A (full screen) + self (top-right PiP)
8. ✅ Both can toggle camera/mic
9. ✅ Video quality is good

---

## 📝 Known Limitations

### Same Device Testing:
When testing with 2 browser windows on ONE laptop:
- ✅ Audio calls work fine
- ❌ Video calls: Only one window can access camera
- ❌ Second window shows "Camera preview unavailable"

**This is NOT a bug!** This is correct browser security behavior.

**Solution:** Use 2 separate devices for video call testing.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Best Call Quality:
1. **Use headphones** - Prevents echo
2. **Good lighting** - Better video quality
3. **Stable internet** - Use WiFi, not mobile data
4. **Close other apps** - Free up camera/microphone
5. **Grant permissions** - Allow camera/mic access

### For Testing:
1. **Audio calls** - Can test on same device with 2 windows
2. **Video calls** - MUST test on 2 separate devices
3. **Use incognito mode** - Fresh permissions for each test
4. **Check browser console** - Watch for errors
